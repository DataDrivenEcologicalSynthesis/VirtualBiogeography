Refined simple question: Are the species shown in the film Finding Nemo accurate in that:
  a) they would occur in the location they are shown in the film
  b) they would occur in the same space as each other 

Plan of attack:
  1) use GBIF R package to download species range maps of each species shown
  2) layer these maps in GIS to see which species should overlap
  3) verify if this is what is shown in the film based on our screenshots
 
End result:
  If the species shown together in the film also have overlapping ranges, then we can say the film is accurate.
  This will likely require a little extra reading on how far a clown fish could actually swim in open water.
