## What we are doing

### The problem
There are many pieces of media content out there that tried to incorporate elements (plants, animals, species interaction, etc.) of the geographical location that it sets in. Whether it's a movie, video game, or podcast, the depiction of biogeography may not be accurate. 
The potrayal of life in the wild in media plays an important role in the public's perception and attitude towards conservations and treatment of wildlife.

### The solution
We use *Finding Nemo* as an example to see how accurate fictional media portrays the biogeography of a real place.
