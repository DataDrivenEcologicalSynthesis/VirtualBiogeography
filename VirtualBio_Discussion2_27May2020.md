## Discussion Note

- Range maps:

    Simpliest way going forward: GIS treatment of GBIF occurence data (Create buffer using `Minimum convex polygon` from occurrence points).

    Format of GBIF data required for Emily: .csv (include only species name and lat/long)

- Resources for pulling range map:
    + [RedlistR](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.04143#sec-2-title) for IUCN Red list range map
    + [ConR package](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.3704)
    + [GBIF maps](https://www.gbif.org/developer/maps)

- Pick five example species for initial analysis (reference community: Nemo's class)

- Expected result figures:
    1. Overlay range maps to show the overlapping areas
    2. Histogram of presence/absence data 
    3. Line graphs with time point/ location change that show data quality -  how many species are you getting at a time point (accomodation curve)
