# Virtual Biogeography
## Project research questions we want to explore

* Where does *Finding Nemo* take place?
  - Are the species featured accurate for the region?

* Are the species *assemblages* accurate in a biogeographical sense?
  - e.g. would we ever see a clownfish hanging around a blue tang in the wild?

* Which species are we surveying for the purposes of this project?
  - Only fish? What about marine plants? Invertebrates? Only the characters with speaking roles?
  -Maybe we can limit to animals only? I'm not sure, but I think some of the plant species in the film were imaginary or generic
