# Virtual Biogeography
## General logistical questions

* How are we going to collect data from the movie?
  - Repeat viewings/overlapping watch segments

* Are there databases we can collect data from for this project?
  - iNat, GBIF might have occurrence records for some of the species to compare distribution/density
  - Fishbase? Dr. Poisot says there is lots of data there but no API

## Project research questions we want to explore

* Where does *Finding Nemo* take place?
  - Are the species featured accurate for the region?

* Are the species *assemblages* accurate in a biogeographical sense?
  - e.g. would we ever see a clownfish hanging around a blue tang in the wild?

* Which species are we surveying for the purposes of this project?
  - Only fish? What about marine plants? Invertebrates? Only the characters with speaking roles?
  - Maybe we can limit to animals only? I'm not sure, but I think some of the plant species in the film were imaginary or generic

* What species interactions are observed? Were any missing?
  - Consumptive interactions (predation)
  - Mutualistic interactions (anenome + clown fish, sharks with the fish?)
  - any competition?
  - are they as common (?) in the movie as in real coral reef systems?
  - traits/behaviours that facilitate these interactions (stinging jelly fish, camoflague?) 
  
* How accurate are the species portrayals? 
  - Can image classification AI identify the species correctly (meaning the representations are fairly accurate) iNaturalist has this feature
  - are some traits missing/wrong/exaggerated (I'm thinking especially for sharks maybe, were their teeth drawn super huge to make them "scary")
